**PD Detective**
This chrome extension will be used to extend the standard functionality of SAP Integration Suite, by providing a method similar to the WhereUsed for JMS Queues, but this time, for ProcessDirect links.

**The extension will be used to extend the standard functionality of SAP Integration Suite.
**
Integration with any SAP Integration Suite CloudFoundry Tenant.
Persist parameters across multiple tenants.
Store the last run timestamp.
Store all the ProcessDirect links even after closing the session.
Ability to visually see the links between flows and packages.
Ability to initial load, and also to schedule recurring refresh intervals.

**Privacy and Data Protection**
The plugin does not collect personal data. Nevertheless the stores like Chrome Web Store collect some anonymous data like how many users have the plugin installed. I work on PDetective in my free time so I want to make sure to only work on functionality that is realy used.

**I guarantee:**

No personal data is collected
No urls, tenant names iflow names etc are collected
only statistical data is collected
the data does not leave
It is open source so feel free to check the source code.
